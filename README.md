## Goal
The goal of this project is to find a cure for ALS(Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis).


## Motivation

A video by [필승쥬](https://www.youtube.com/@blossom_joo) that I discovered by chance on YouTube deeply moved my heart.  
The video showed a bright and energetic girl slowly becoming exhausted and losing strength due to Lou Gehrig's disease(ALS).  
Among the comments "I hope a miracle happens" below the video, I was caught up in an unknown sense of helplessness.  
In the video that followed, the feeling of helplessness grew as I read about [the speed of disease progressing faster than the speed of development of new drugs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88OhEAbFr0&t=374s).  

After a brief search, I found out that it was a disease that had not even been identified as a clear cause until now, but I just didn't want to stay helpless.  
Knowing that miracles don't happen by themselves, I thought someone had to move to create them.  

I believe in the enormous power of human collective intelligence, although brilliant researchers are already engaged in research.  
Therefore, I decided to start a project that could contribute even a little to finding a cure for Lou Gehrig's disease(ALS).  

The reason for detailing the motivation of the project is not to forget why I started this at the beginning, even if the project goes on over a long period of time.  

I sincerely hope that this project can be a light of hope for those suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease(ALS).  


## Methodology

For the scalability of the project, I will basically write it in English,  
but I will try to translate English materials into Korean as much as possible for Lou Gehrig patients who are native to Korean to read.
